# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using **Vue 3** and **Vite**. The app provides weather information for different cities using data fetched from a weather API (e.g., Weatherbit API). It's designed to help you get started with **Vue 3** and **Vite**, providing a clean structure for development.

## Features
- **Real-time Weather Data**: Displays the current weather information for any city.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and responsive UI to search for weather by city.
- **API Integration**: Fetches data from an external weather API (Weatherbit or similar).
- **Dark/Light Mode**: (Optional) You can integrate a mode switch for better usability.

## Project Setup

### Recommended IDE Setup

- **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**: A popular code editor for Vue 3 development.
- **[Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)**: Vue 3 tooling for VSCode.
- **[TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin)**: If you're working with TypeScript, this plugin is recommended.

Make sure to disable **Vetur** as it's not required if you're using Volar.

## Install Dependencies

First, you’ll need to install the necessary project dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies based on the `package.json` file.

## Development

### Run in Development Mode

To run the app in development mode and enable hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Build

To compile and minify the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized production build.

## API Integration

To get weather data, you’ll need to integrate an external weather API. You can use a service like **Weatherbit API** or any other service that provides weather information.

- **API Key**: Sign up for an API key from [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/) (or another provider).
- **Configuration**: Add your API key in the appropriate configuration file or environment variables for secure access.

## Deployment

You can deploy the app using any service like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages**. Just follow the respective deployment guides for Vue 3 apps.

### Deploy on Vercel

To deploy on Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Connect your GitHub repository to **Vercel**.
3. Follow the prompts to deploy.
